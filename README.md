# README

A refresher and explorer of Rails 5, this project will journal issues or items needing deeper investigation in the Rails 5 framework.

* This first few attempts were failing because the project was defined as a Rails API project.
That is a slimmer Rails environment, not the one I was looking for.

* Successfully worked through 5.3.
Will examine all generated artifacts before moving onto models and database actions.

* Successfully worked through 5.9.
