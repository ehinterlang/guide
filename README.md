# README

As a refresher and Rails 5 exploration activity,
I will journal items I encounter and need to explore further.

* Working through the Rails 5 Guides, the generate controller task does not create all the files that are expected.
Additionally, Sections 4.2 and 4.3 do not work as expected.
I rendered a trivial text right in the controller.
Even html markups did not work.

* Continuing on to Section 5 of the Guide.
Hopefully, the introductory problems will becomer clearer.
